# CS61B-Gitlet

This is the repository of the final individual project, Gitlet, in CS61B: Data Structures, Spring 2020 (I got A+ for it). 
The official spec of the project can be found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/materials/proj/proj3/index.html).

In this project, I implemented a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git starting from the sketch. 
I acheived the maximum scores on the project, i.e., managing to implement all the required and extra functionalities.
